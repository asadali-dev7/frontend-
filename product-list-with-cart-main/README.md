# Product List with Cart Challenge

This is my solution for the **Product List with Cart Challenge** on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). The goal of this project is to build a responsive product list page with a fully functional shopping cart. Users can add products to the cart, remove them, adjust quantities, and confirm their orders with an interactive modal—all while enjoying a seamless experience on any device.
