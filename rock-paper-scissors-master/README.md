# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

This is my solution for the **Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge** on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). The goal of this project is to create a responsive Rock, Paper, Scissors game that closely matches the provided design. Users can play against the computer and see their score update in real-time.

**Bonus:** I also implemented the extended version—Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock—to offer a more engaging gameplay experience.
