# Shortly URL Shortening API Challenge

This is my solution for the **Shortly URL Shortening API Challenge** on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). The goal of this project is to build a responsive landing page that integrates with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) for shortening URLs. Users can shorten any valid URL, view their history (persisted with local storage), and copy the shortened URL to their clipboard with a single click.

The Shortly project is a fully responsive landing page designed with a modern UI. It allows users to quickly shorten URLs using an API, view a list of their shortened links even after refreshing the browser, and copy these links easily.

### The Challenge

- **Responsive Design:** Adapt layouts for both mobile and desktop.
- **API Integration:** Communicate with the Clean URI API to generate shortened URLs.
- **Persistent Storage:** Save shortened URLs using local storage.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Implement a one-click copy functionality.
- **Form Validation:** Display error messages if the input field is empty.
