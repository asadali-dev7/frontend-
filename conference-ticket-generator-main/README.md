Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# Conference Ticket Generator Challenge

This is my solution for the **Conference Ticket Generator Challenge** on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). In this project, I developed a responsive and accessible web application that allows users to generate a conference ticket by filling out a form with their details. The application features real-time form validation, keyboard-only navigation, and accessibility enhancements to ensure a seamless user experience.
